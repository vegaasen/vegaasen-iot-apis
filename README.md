# Introduction

This is a collection of the APIs that I use in my everyday. They are either being used through an app, a website, a program or similar :-)

# Current APIs

This is the list of the current APIs which is included in the "small APIs and IOT-like package" of mine:

## Donald Duck Pocket

API that exposes all the pocket books which has been published and some of the details. Aditionally, I've created a service which enables a user to register which he/she has, or missing. Kinda awsome, no? :-P

### REST API

## Certificate overview

This is just an application which holds an overview of all my ssl-enabled web applications or applications. It basically just holds the state of the expiration date and information regarding the certificate. In this way, I can easily monitor the state of the certificates out there :-)
